# 🍽️ Restaurant Rating Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **machine learning model** that predicts the **aggregate rating** of a restaurant based on various features such as location, cuisine type, price range, and customer reviews.

## ⚡ Key Steps
✔️ **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split data into training & testing sets.
✔️ **Model Selection** – Choose a regression algorithm such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest.
✔️ **Training & Evaluation** – Train the model and evaluate it using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
✔️ **Feature Analysis** – Identify key factors influencing restaurant ratings.

## 📋 Workflow
🔹 **Step 1:** Data Cleaning – Handle missing values and outliers.  
🔹 **Step 2:** Feature Engineering – Convert categorical variables and normalize numerical data.  
🔹 **Step 3:** Model Training – Train the regression model using training data.  
🔹 **Step 4:** Model Evaluation – Measure accuracy using evaluation metrics.  
🔹 **Step 5:** Insights & Interpretation – Analyze influential features affecting ratings.  

## 📊 Expected Outcomes
🎯 A well-trained **regression model** that accurately predicts restaurant ratings.  
📈 Insights into **key factors** influencing customer reviews and ratings.  
📊 Performance evaluation of different models to choose the best approach.
